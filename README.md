# AssetFinder
This is bash scripting code, something of what was given a clue about in the PNPT Class I am taking, but from there on I have worked on its banner, made the code and used the command the best to my understanding. Its an ever enhancing code, made duly for personal use to check the whois of the IP, its subdomains, if the domains are live and then to take a screenshots of the domain. This acts as a major part of Open Source Intelligence ( OSINT ) for the source.

It is recommended that you download the code in a directory so that it can be utilized purely for the code 

The initialization does require the downloading of certain tools:
  1) Whois 
  2) Subfinder 
  3) Assetfinder 
  4) httprobe
  5) gowitness 
  
 These are tools in linux, and have their own github repositories for setup, you can have a look at those.
 
Running the Code :  
   ! Move into the directory that has the code  
   !  chmod +x automate.sh  
   ! ./automate.sh {domain}
